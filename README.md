# DonutsOnTheWay


Hi! This is a small web application I made for Question 2: Making a Good Impression of the Intern Challenge offered by ClickTime.

Your challenge is to write an application that will answer the following question: how can you get from your current location to the ClickTime office, if you have to stop off somewhere to get coffee and donuts for the dev team? Your application should always start at the user's current location, which could be anywhere in the United States (don't worry about overseas).


## Install

```
$ npm install
```

## Execution

```
$ npm start
```

Open localhost:8080 in your browser once you see the bundle has compiled successfully in terminal.
